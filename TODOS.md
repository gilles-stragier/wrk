# Todos & Roadmap

* Find a better way to abstract trello ids. wrk1 are insufficient for our needs. Maybe we could just generate a short unique id on the fly, and keep using that all the time
    * generate w type dependent sequential id and try it
* Provide completion
* Show a more in depth description of each stuff
* Restructure command line (more porcelain style - whatever). What about
```
$ wrk boards add
$ wrk boards ls -f status=bazar
$ wrk orgs close
```
* Checklist management
* Manage multiple accounts
* User input required attributes
* Release to github on commit or not
* An (auto) update command
