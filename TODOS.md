# Todos & Roadmap

* Reorganize caommand line parsing, so that options can be added in a more flexible way (jsonoutputter)
* Allow wommands to handle lists
* A more compact outputter (with tables)
* An extended configuration mechanism
* Provide a command to clean / manage ids cache
* Show a more in depth description of each stuff
* It seems a bit slower ... let's check that
* Restructure command line (more porcelain style - whatever). What about
```
$ wrk boards add
$ wrk boards ls -f status=bazar
$ wrk orgs close
```
* Checklist management
* Manage multiple accounts
* User input required attributes
* Release to github on commit or not
* An (auto) update command
